### 1. What is Deep Learning?

* Deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning that uses algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain’s neural networks.
* In the field of deep learning, the term artificial neural network (ANN) is used interchangeably with the following terminologies:
  * Net
  * Neural Net
  * Model

### What is a Neural Network?

* Introduction to neural network has been discussed in previous post
* Neural Networks replicate the way humans learn, inspired by how the neurons in our brains fire, only much simpler.
* The most common Neural Networks consist of three network layers:
  * An input layer
  * A hidden layer (this is the most important layer where feature extraction takes place and adjustments are made to train faster and function better)
  * An output layer
* Each layer contains neurons called “nodes,” performing various operations. Neural Networks are used in deep learning algorithms like CNN, RNN, GAN, etc.
