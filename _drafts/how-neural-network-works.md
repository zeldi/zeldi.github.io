In this post, I will write about the Neural Network basics and its key features.

### What is Neural Network?
* Motivation behind neural network is human brain. Human brain is called as the best processor even though it works slower than other computers. Many researchers thought to make a machine that would work in the prospective of the human brain
* Human information processing takes place through the interaction of many billions of neurons connected to each other sending signals to other neurons.
* Similarly, a Neural Network is a network of artificial neurons, as found in human brains, for solving artificial intelligence problems such as image identification. They may be a physical device or mathematical constructs.
* In other words, Artificial Neural Network is a parallel computational system consisting of many simple processing elements connected to perform a particular task.

- Dendrite receives signals from other neurons.
- Cell body sums the incoming signals to generate input.
- When the sum reaches a threshold value, neuron fires and the signal travels down the axon to the other neurons.
- The amount of signal transmitted depend upon the strength of the connections.
- Connections can be inhibitory, i.e. decreasing strength or excitatory, i.e. increasing strength in nature.

In the similar manner, it was thought to make artificial interconnected neurons like biological neurons making up an Artificial Neural Network(ANN). Each biological neuron is capable of taking a number of inputs and produce output.
Neurons in human brain are capable of making very complex decisions, so this means they run many parallel processes for a particular task. One motivation for ANN is that to work for a particular task identification through many parallel processes.
