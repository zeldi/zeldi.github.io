At the moment I am working on OpenShift, here I am writing stuff that is exciting and I keep forgetting. The list has (almost) no order and is very random. By the way: there is also an official cheat sheet

### Basic Openshift Commands

**Create and switch project**

```
oc new-project thespark
oc projects
oc project thespark
oc delete project thespark
```

**Expose applications**
```
oc expose dc/hallogo --port=8080 (generates a service from deployment configuration)
oc expose svc/hallogo (generares a route from service)
```

**Describe etc. resource types, print to yaml**
```
oc describe bc
oc describe dc
oc get secret gitlab-hallospark -o yaml
oc get user
oc get nodes
```
**Templates**
```
oc get templates -n openshift 
oc describe template postgresql-persistent -n openshift
oc get template jenkins-pipeline-example -n openshift -o yaml
oc export all --as-template=javapg
```

**Image streams**

update an external image stream with the newest version: (e.g. iceScrum):
```
oc get is
oc import-image icescrum
```

**Collect all logs of a namespace:**
```
#!/bin/bash

namespace='openshift-monitoring'
oc project $namespace
mkdir -p $namespace-logs/pod

for pod in $(oc get pods -o name -n $namespace); do 
     echo "$pod"
     echo "======$pod (tailed to 2000 lines=====" >> $namespace-logs/$pod-logs.txt
     oc logs $pod --all-containers --tail 2000 >> $namespace-logs/$pod-logs.txt 
done

tar -cvf $namespace-logs.tar $namespace-logs/
```

### Some Admin's Day-2 Commands

**Garbage Collection**

configure garbage collection.

get rid of evicted pods:
```
oc get pod --all-namespaces  | grep Evicted
oc get pod --all-namespaces  | awk '{if ($4=="Evicted") print "oc delete pod " $2 " -n " $1;}' | sh 
```

get rid of garbage by pruning:
(as a cluster admin on a master node, so that registry is accessible)

```
oc login -u rschumm

oc adm prune builds --confirm 
oc adm prune images --confirm 
```
list, describe and delete all resources with a label:
```
oc get all --selector app=hallospark -o yaml
oc describe all --selector app=hallospark
oc delete all --selector app=hallospark 
oc delete pvc --all 
```
… e.g. delete (and restart) all Prometheus node-exporter and prometheus logs pods:
```
oc project openshift-monitoring
oc get -o name pods --selector app=node-exporter
oc delete pods --selector app=node-exporter
oc delete pods --selector app=prometheus
```
look for Pods with DiskPressure
```
oc describe node  | grep -i NodeHasDiskPressure
```
drain and reboot node:
```
oc adm manage-node ocp-app-1 --schedulable=false
oc adm drain ocp-app-1

systemctl restart atomic-openshift-node.service
```

**Adding NFS Provisioner**

In [okd documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.html), dynamic persistence volume provisioning for nfs is not supported. So we have to use following [incubator](https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage/tree/master/nfs-client)

Clone the repo and go to the folder above.
```
$ oc new-project nfs-provisioner
```

then replace the namespace with following code snippets:
```
# Set the subject of the RBAC objects to the current namespace where the provisioner is being deployed
$ NAMESPACE=`oc project -q`
$ sed -i'' "s/namespace:.*/namespace: $NAMESPACE/g" ./deploy/rbac.yaml
$ oc create -f deploy/rbac.yaml
$ oadm policy add-scc-to-user hostmount-anyuid system:serviceaccount:$NAMESPACE:nfs-client-provisioner
```
in deployment.yaml, replace the values accordingly, e.g.:
```
server: 10.0.0.14
path: /var/nfs/general
```
then apply the files.
```
oc apply -f 
- rbac.yaml
- class.yaml
- deployment.yaml 
```
the provisioner will run as a normal pod and create pv when they are claimed, including making directories on the server and deleting them.

To make the new storage class the default one, patch it with:
```
$kubectl patch storageclass managed-nfs-storage -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'
```
