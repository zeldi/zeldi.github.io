Jekyll is a simple and blog-aware static site generator built in Ruby. In laymen terms, it’s just a tool to let you have all the cool features of a full-blown CMS without having to worry about managing a database. This means hosting is extremely easy and scalable since all you’re doing is managing a bunch of files.
