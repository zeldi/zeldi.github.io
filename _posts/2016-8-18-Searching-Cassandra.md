This is a simple note on the challenges of learning Apache Cassandra. 

I personally search every single things about Cassandra by using Google. Apparently, sometime the results from google search does not give accurate answers for my cassandra related questions. It is because of the progression in its development. Since its first release, Apache Cassandra has changed a lot in a short period of time, going from the thrift API to CQL 2 to CQL 3. Many API, features have been added. At the same time many features have also been added to the current development.

So if you run a Google search itâ€™s very easy to end up reading about things that are already obselete and not current best practices, like super columns, the thrift api, cassandra-cli, etc. There are still a lot of blog posts and documentation out there using the old APIs, 

Therefore, if you are a new user and has a lot of question about Apache Cassandra thre are several ways to look for accurate answers:

1. <a href="http://www.datastax.com/docs">The Datastax Documentation</a>
2. Post email to user@cassandra.apache.org
3. Or browse the <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/cassandra-user/">Archive</a>
4. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cassandra">Search and Ask question via Stack Overflow </a>

Happy Learning Cassandra!!
