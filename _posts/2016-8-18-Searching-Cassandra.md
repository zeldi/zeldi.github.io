This is a note on the challenge of learning Apache Cassandra. 

I personally search every single things about Cassandra by using Goole, apparently, sometime the results from google search does not give accurate answer for my cassandra related question. It is because progression in its development. Since its first release, Apache Cassandra has changed a lot in a short period of time, going from the thrift API to CQL 2 to CQL 3. 

So if you run a Google search itâ€™s very easy to end up reading about things that are already obselete and not current best practices, like super columns, the thrift api, cassandra-cli, etc. There are still a lot of blog posts and documentation out there using the old APIs, 

Therefore, if you are a new user and has a lot of question about Apache Cassandra thre are several ways to look for accurate answers:

1. <a href="http://www.datastax.com/docs">The Datastax Documentation</a>
2. Post email to user@cassandra.apache.org
3. Or browse the <a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/cassandra-user/">Archive</a>
4. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/cassandra">Search and Ask question via Stack Overflow </a>
