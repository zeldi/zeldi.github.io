Hello. My name is Zeldi Suryady. I'm a challenge-driven person. I am internally motivated in challenging myself to improve my own skills, experience, and productivity. Hence, I have constant interest in learning new technologies, and paradigms.

My programming experience started with Turbo Pascal. Iâ€™ve become skilled in Object Oriented after I started learning C++. My professional experience sums to about 10 years in Software Engineering and Computer Networking. For a long time, I used C/C++ for programming Network protocols. I also did embedded programming for Wireless Sensor Network using C/C++. Being actively working on variety of Internet of Things (IOT) projects makes me a polyglot programmer, using C/C++, Perl scripting and sometime PHP. At my current role, I do mostly Node.JS and Javascript. I also doing automated development using Grunt and also Docker for containerization.

I don't aspire to be in management role. At my current role, I am a Lead Engineer of a small team doing specific project on Internet of Things (IOT). For future career development, I want to either lead larger teams or be a part of a small high-impact project where quality and time to market is crucial.

At my free time, I watch movies, play football, archery, and some eventual programming for fun.
